    "# Question no.1: Which function is used to open a file ? What are the different modes of opening a file ? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "### Answer:In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two parameters: the name of the file to be opened and the mode in which the file is to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'r': read mode - opens a file for reading. If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'w': write mode - opens a file for writing. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file. If the file already exists, it will overwrite the existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'a': append mode - opens a file for appending data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'x': exclusive mode - opens a file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. If the file exists, it will raise a FileExistsError error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'b': binary mode - opens a file in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 't': text mode - opens a file in text mode. This is the default mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### '+': read and write mode - opens a file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The modes can be combined by using them together. For example, 'rb' opens a file in binary mode for reading, and 'w+' opens a file for both reading and writing, and overwrites the existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's an example of how to open a file in read mode:\n",
    "## file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "### This will open the file named example.txt in read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's an example of how to open a file in write mode:\n",
    "## file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "### This will open the file named example.txt in write mode. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be truncated (emptied).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's an example of how to open a file in append mode:\n",
    "## file = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",

    "# Question no.2: Why close() function is used ? Why is it important to close a file ?\n",
    "### Answer: The close() function is used in Python to close a file that was previously opened using the open() function. It is important to close a file after you have finished reading from or writing to it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Release resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to it, such as memory and file handles. If you don't close the file after you're done using it, those resources will remain allocated until the program terminates, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and reduced system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data integrity: If you don't close the file after you've finished writing to it, there is a risk that not all the data you wrote will be flushed to disk. This can lead to data loss or corruption, especially in the event of a power failure or system crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: If you don't close the file, it may be possible for another process or user to read from or write to the file while your program is still running, potentially leading to data leakage or other security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To close a file in Python, simply call the close() method on the file object, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "## file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "###  ###Do some operations on the file\n",
    "## file.close()\n",
    "### It's good practice to always close files that you open in your code, to avoid any potential issues with resource leaks or data corruption. Alternatively, you can use the with statement to automatically close the file when the block is exited:\n",
    "\n",
    "## with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "   ###  #Do some operations on the file\n",
    "  ###  #File is automatically closed when block is exited\n",
    "### This way, even if there is an exception or error in your code, the file will still be properly closed."
